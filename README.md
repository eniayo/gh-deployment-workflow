##GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
Overview
This project demonstrates the concept of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) by using GitHub Actions to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages. The workflow is triggered by changes to the index.html file in the main branch.

Features
Automatic Deployment: Deploys changes to GitHub Pages whenever index.html is updated.

Continuous Integration: Ensures that any changes made to the index.html file are automatically integrated and deployed.

Requirements
A GitHub account

A public GitHub repository

Getting Started
Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
Create a new public repository on GitHub called gh-deployment-workflow.

Add a simple index.html file with the content "Hello, GitHub Actions!".

Add a README.md file explaining the project.

Step 2: Create GitHub Actions Workflow
In your repository, create a directory called .github/workflows.

Inside the workflows directory, create a file named deploy.yml.

Example deploy.yml
Add the following content to the deploy.yml file:

yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'index.html'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Pages
        id: pages
        uses: actions/setup-pages@v1

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: page
          path: ./

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./
          https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-actions-deployment-workflow
Step 3: Push Changes to GitHub
Push your changes to the main branch of your repository.

Example Commands
bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/gh-deployment-workflow.git
git push -u origin main
Step 4: Access Your Website
After the workflow runs successfully, your website will be accessible at https://<username>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/.

Stretch Goals
To make this project more practical, consider using a static site generator such as Hugo, Jekyll, Astro, or a similar generator to create a more complex website, such as your personal portfolio.
